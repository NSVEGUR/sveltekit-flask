## Introduction

This is a hybrid Sveltekit + Python app that uses Sveltekit as the frontend and Flask as the API backend. One great use case of this is to write Sveltekit apps that use Python AI libraries on the backend.

## How It Works

The Python/Flask server is mapped into to Next.js app under `/api/`.

This is implemented using [`hook.server.ts` rewrites](https://github.com/vercel/examples/blob/main/python/nextjs-flask/next.config.js) to map any request to `/api/:path*` to the Flask API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder.

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:3000` port, which is where the Flask server is running.

In production, the Flask server is hosted as [Python serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python) on Vercel.

## Developing Locally

You can clone & create this repo with the following command

```bash
npx create-next-app nextjs-flask --example "https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/python/nextjs-flask"
```

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

Add `.env` file and create `API_ADDRESS` and `CLIENT_API_ADDRESS` which are flask address and the client address what you want to map respectively. Sample is given in `.env.example` which can work as default.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

The Flask server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) – feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `.env`).
